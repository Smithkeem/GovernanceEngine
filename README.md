GovernanceEngine
----------------

üìú Overview
-----------

The **GovernanceEngine** is a sophisticated smart contract designed to automate and optimize the decentralized governance process. It acts as a **filtering and prioritization engine** for on-chain governance proposals, moving beyond simple voting to incorporate a multi-dimensional, data-driven evaluation framework. This system ensures that the most impactful, feasible, and community-supported proposals are given the highest priority, thereby enhancing the efficiency and effectiveness of the DAO's decision-making.

By implementing a combination of **quantitative scoring algorithms** and **conditional logic**, the contract evaluates proposals based on key metrics: technical feasibility, financial implications, and community support. The system dynamically ranks proposals, providing a transparent and objective mechanism to identify and fast-track those that offer the most value to the ecosystem.

This contract is built on the Clarity smart contract language for the Stacks blockchain, leveraging its security and auditable nature to provide a robust and trust-minimized governance layer.

üöÄ Features
-----------

-   **Automated Proposal Submission:** Users can submit governance proposals by staking a minimum amount of STX, ensuring a commitment to the process and mitigating spam.

-   **Multi-Criteria Evaluation:** Proposals are scored across three primary dimensions: **Community Support**, **Technical Feasibility**, and **Financial Impact**, each with a predefined weighting.

-   **Advanced Scoring Algorithms:** A private `calculate-composite-score` function combines the weighted scores to produce a single, comprehensive metric for each proposal.

-   **Proposal Filtering:** Proposals must meet a minimum community score threshold to be considered "QUALIFIED" for further consideration, effectively filtering out proposals with low social consensus.

-   **Dynamic Prioritization:** The contract includes logic to update priority rankings, though the comprehensive ranking mechanism is simplified for this version. The system is designed for automated prioritization.

-   **Authorized Evaluators:** The contract owner can authorize specific principals (addresses) as governance evaluators, who are responsible for providing objective scores. This allows for a curated, expert-driven evaluation process.

-   **Comprehensive Analysis Engine:** The `execute-comprehensive-proposal-analysis-engine` function showcases a hypothetical, advanced analysis pipeline, simulating a system that could incorporate machine learning, sentiment analysis, and predictive analytics to generate detailed insights and recommendations.

-   **Proposal Lifecycle Management:** Proposals are tracked through various stages (`SUBMITTED`, `QUALIFIED`, `FILTERED`) and have a defined validity period to prevent expired or stale proposals from clogging the system.

-   **Emergency Mode:** The contract includes an `emergency-mode` variable that can be toggled by the contract owner to temporarily halt new proposal submissions, providing a safety mechanism in critical situations.

üìã Contract Functions
---------------------

### `define-private` Functions

-   `(calculate-composite-score (community uint) (technical uint) (financial uint))`: This function computes a weighted composite score for a proposal. It takes the individual scores and multiplies them by their respective weights (`COMMUNITY-WEIGHT`, `TECHNICAL-WEIGHT`, `FINANCIAL-WEIGHT`) before summing them and dividing by 100. This provides a normalized, final score for prioritization.

-   `(validate-proposal-eligibility (creator principal) (stake uint))`: A helper function that checks if a new proposal is eligible for submission. It verifies that the staked amount meets the `MIN-PROPOSAL-STAKE`, the number of active proposals is below the `MAX-PROPOSALS-PER-CYCLE` limit, and `emergency-mode` is not enabled.

-   `(is-proposal-expired (proposal-id uint))`: Checks if a proposal's validity period has elapsed by comparing the current `block-height` to the proposal's `submission-block` plus the `PROPOSAL-VALIDITY-PERIOD`.

-   `(update-priority-rankings)`: A simplified placeholder function that represents the logic for re-calculating and updating the priority ranks of all active proposals within a governance cycle.

* * * * *

### `define-public` Functions

-   `(authorize-evaluator (evaluator principal) (expertise (list 5 (string-ascii 20))))`: Allows the `CONTRACT-OWNER` to grant a specific `principal` the role of a governance evaluator. The function stores their authorized status and areas of expertise.

-   `(submit-proposal (title (string-ascii 100)) (category (string-ascii 20)) (stake-amount uint))`: This is the primary entry point for submitting a new governance proposal. It validates eligibility, handles the required STX stake transfer, and initializes the proposal's data entry in the `proposals` and `proposal-metrics` maps.

-   `(evaluate-proposal (proposal-id uint) (community-score uint) (technical-score uint) (financial-score uint))`: A function callable only by an authorized evaluator. It allows an evaluator to submit their scores for a specific proposal. The function validates the sender's authorization and the proposal's existence and status before updating its scores and status.

-   `(execute-comprehensive-proposal-analysis-engine (proposal-id uint) (enable-sentiment-analysis bool) (enable-risk-modeling bool) (enable-predictive-analytics bool) (analysis-depth-level uint))`: A complex function designed to showcase the potential for advanced analytics. It simulates a comprehensive analysis pipeline, generating and printing detailed, multi-dimensional reports and optimization recommendations.

üìä Data Structures
------------------

-   `next-proposal-id` (data-var, uint): Tracks the next available ID for a new proposal.

-   `governance-cycle-count` (data-var, uint): Increments with each governance cycle to track progress.

-   `total-active-proposals` (data-var, uint): Counts the number of proposals currently active in the system.

-   `emergency-mode` (data-var, bool): A boolean flag to pause new submissions.

-   `proposals` (data-map): Stores core information about each proposal, including its creator, title, stake amount, status, and scores.

-   `proposal-metrics` (data-map): Contains supplementary metrics and initial values for a proposal, such as complexity, cost, and risk assessment.

-   `governance-evaluators` (data-map): Maps authorized evaluators to their details, including their expertise, evaluation count, and accuracy rating.

üõ†Ô∏è Getting Started
-------------------

### Prerequisites

-   A Stacks Wallet (e.g., Leather, Xverse).

-   A testnet account with sufficient STX for testing.

-   A Clarity development environment (e.g., Clarinet, the Stacks Sandbox).

### Deployment

    Bash

    ```
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/governance-engine.git
    cd governance-engine

    ```

2.  **Deploy the Contract:** Use a tool like Clarinet or the Stacks Sandbox to deploy the contract to a testnet or mainnet.

    Bash

    ```
    clarinet deploy

    ```

3.  **Set Up the Owner:** The address that deploys the contract will automatically be set as the `CONTRACT-OWNER`.

4.  **Authorize Evaluators:** As the owner, call the `authorize-evaluator` function to grant evaluation permissions to trusted addresses.

5.  **Submit a Proposal:** Any user can then call the `submit-proposal` function with the required stake to initiate the governance process.
